<h3 class="p12"> <center>What if I said that the cloud is actually not in the sky? What if I said that the cloud is a big building? If you are courious than this article will tell you all about it!</center></h3>

<p class="p12"> When you put something in the "cloud", what do you think? You probably don't know what happens. When you put something in the cloud, it is actually going to a data center. A data center is actually just servers. If you put multiple servers together
you get a data center. There are samll data centers that anyone can own. These can be just a few servers on a rack. The servers in a data center hold data. They act like teh hard drives on your computer, however you are connecting to them over the internet. There are also lareg data centers.
These can be whole warehouses. Much bigger than your house. Just full of servers. This is what companyies like google and microsoft have. This means that whenever you put something in the "cloud",
you are actually just puttiing it on googles servers. Say your using google docs. It autosaves, meaning that whenever you edit it it is constantally saving.
So whenever you edit a file on google docs, it is sending the updated version to googles servers, and that is where it is save. Whenever you open aa file, it is going to googles data centers and
finding the file you want to open. This is the very basics of a how a data center works.</p>
