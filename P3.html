<h2 class= h22> <center> Parts of a Computer </center></h2>
<h3 class="p12"> <center>There are many parts of a computer. However the mane ones are: The motherboard, The CPU, The GPU (Sometimes) The storage (SSD or HHD) The power supply, The case, and the Ram.</center></h3>
<br>
<pc class="p12"> 
The motherboard is the base of the system. It is what everything connects to and is liek teh home base. <br>
The CPU is the most important part. It computes everything but the graphics on the system. <br>
The GPU computes the graphics. However, the GPU is commonly inside the CPU, meaning teh CPU is also computing the graphics. <br>
The storage is pretty self explanatory. It is where everything is stored. <br>
The power supply distributes power to all of the components in teh system. It is connected to the wall. However, this is not teh battery. We are talking about non-laptop PCs <br>
The case is where all of the components are in. <br>
The ram is temporary storage. It stores stuff that your PC needs to remember for a short amount of time, but all gets deleted when your PC gets powered off. It is also deleted if your PC does not need it any more. <br>
These are all of the main parts of a PC. Next time you see one, ask however owns it what parts they used. Ask them what CPU they used or Motherboard.</p>
